<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Parent Education and Family Stabilization Course.</p>
<p>This class consists of ten chapters. Each chapter has a timer at the bottom of the page. You must spend the time provided reading each chapter of this course. Chapters 1-7 each take 30 minutes to complete. Chapter 8 is 20 minutes and Chapter 9 is 10 minutes.</p>
<p>When the timer reaches zero, you advance to the next page by clicking the blue “Continue” button that will appear at the bottom of the page. Please note that chapter completion is only counted when you click the blue “Continue” button.</p>
<p>It will take at least four hours to complete this course. However, each chapter is 30 minutes or less in length. You can complete the course at your own pace, chapter by chapter, 30 minutes at a time. Your progress is saved when you click the blue “Continue” button to advance to the next chapter of the class.</p>
<p>Use the links on the right panel to review any lesson you have already completed.</p>
<p>If you previously started this class, you can immediately go to the last chapter you reached by using the right panel links.</p>
<p>Each chapter ends with true and false questions. The correct answers are provided. These questions are not graded. They act as a review of the prior chapter.</p>
<p>However, there is an end of class test -- a “no fail” test. Florida law now requires that all parenting classes include a test. You must successfully pass this test with a grade of 70% or higher. But you may take the test as many times as you need in order to pass. Your certificate is automatically emailed to you when you successfully pass the test.</p>
<p>You may communicate with the provider of this course at Admin@AaronClasses.com.</p>
<blockquote><b>
By clicking the blue "CONTINUE" button below, I hereby verify and affirm that I am TEST TIM, and that I will personally read and review all course materials and take the required end of course test.
