                            <p>
                                I offer the highest quality of care to my clients. I am friendly and knowledgeable and care about all aspects of your treatment. I customize each treatment to meet your specific needs by incorporating a variety of assessment and treatment techniques that are best suited to you as an individual.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As part of our service, I will provide you with knowledge of self-administered pain management techniques such as stretching and strengthening exercises and the use of heat or cold therapy, which will help you get the most out of each treatment.
                                My practice is dedicated to improving the general well-being of all my clients.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                East End Therapeutics is located in the heart of Stouffville, just east of the clock tower.  You will find the location easy to get to with free parking surrounding the clinic.  The clinic itself is bright and open, with areas for assessment, interviewing and treatment.  It is very important that each client is treated individually and the spaces have taken this into account, where we can work to find out exactly how you need to be treated.
                            </p>  

                            <p>
                                In trying to find out how you need to be treated, you may be asked to do a walking/running assessment on the treadmill, range of motion exercises, interview regarding your past/current health concerns or special orthopedic tests.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At East End Therapeutics, you will never be asked to get on the treatment table without discussion of how or why you need to be treated.  Each time you come in, you will be greeted warmly, with your individual needs in mind.  
                                When you choose East End Therapeutics, you are valued as a client.  Working together as therapist and client, we will develop a plan to reach your goals, whether it be recovery from injury, return to sport, improved quality of life or just finding time to manage stress.

                        Over the last 14+ years Elijah has worked in specialized chiropractic clinics, sports medicine clinics along with spa settings and on-site sporting events.  Working with sports injuries and repetitive stress injuries are what Elijah has found to be the most interesting part of his practice, and enjoys working with conditions that have been hard to solve.  Elijah believes that massage therapy can be part of a client's general wellness routine and lifestyle as well as for acute pain and discomfort.  He has done training in <a href="myofascial">myofascial</a> release, <a href="kinesio">kinesiology</a> taping, ultrasound, electrotherapy, Chinese cupping, as well as prenatal massage. With a genuine concern for the well-being of his clients and a desire to provide the best care, Elijah has combined “relaxation” and “therapeutic” massage therapy into his practice.  Elijah is excited to begin his practice here at East End Therapeutics. <br><br>

                        When Elijah is not working with clients, and, if he’s lucky, he’s enjoying outdoors with his wife and sons.
