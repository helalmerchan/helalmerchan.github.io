                                <h4>Swedish Massage</h4>
                                <p>Swedish massage is the best-known and most popular type of massage therapy that combines a variety of techniques on the back, arms, legs, neck and other body parts to target tissues and muscles for maximal pain relief, stress release and relaxation.  It can also help increase circulation and decrease inflammation and swelling. Massage therapy can also help reduce adhesions built up around scar tissue, so treatments after an injury or surgical procedure can be hugely beneficial to the appearance of the scar and surrounding areas. Prenatal massage can also be a great way to relax sore, strained muscles from the hormonal shifts that occur during pregnancy.  Massage is a great treatment for people of all ages and physical abilities.
