                        <h3>Holly Milliner</h3>
                        <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">I’m a 2007 graduate from Algonquin College’s Massage Therapy Program and member of the Registered Massage Therapist’s Association of Ontario. I have experience in working with newborns to the elderly and everything in between. I provide client-centered care, working together with you and the rest of your health care team in order to create lasting results that go beyond the treatment room.  I grew up in Kanata and have lived in Stittsville since 2013, and am very excited to be working in the heart of this growing community. I stay active by chasing around after my two sons, and squeezing in some hot yoga or runs (well more like walking) on the beautiful Trans Canada Trail. </p>

                        <h3>Blair Dunbar</h3>
                        <p>I have always been intrigued in the human body, being actively involved in exercise and health science.  I am originally from London, Ontario, where I earned a Bachelor of Health Sciences Degree at The University of Western Ontario.   I continued my studies in Ottawa at Everest College’s Registered Massage Therapy program, and have been a practising RMT since 2013.</p>
                        
<p>As a therapist, I am perceptive, sensitive, and compassionate.  I truly believe in treating the body as a whole.  My passion for health and for learning has led me to a career in osteopathy.  I have completed the five years of osteopathic study at the Canadian College of Osteopathy in Toronto, and I have completed my Certificate in Osteopathy (Theory, Practical, Clinical and Methodology), as Class Valedictorian in November 2016.   I am currently conducting the research for my thesis, and will graduate with a Diploma in Osteopathic Manual Practice (D.O.M.P.) in 2018.  My thesis topic is “The Effects of Normalization of the Digestive Ducts and the Digestive Pyramid on Lumbar Spine Range of Motion.”</p>

<p>I am a sports fan, and have played baseball, hockey, and football both competitively and recreationally.  I have worked as a therapist at the Ottawa Senator’s development camp for the past three seasons, including this year.</p>

<p>Using both massage and osteopathy, I specialize in the following manual therapy techniques:  Myofascial Release, Cranial Sacral Therapy, Visceral Manipulation, and Scar Tissue Release.    I treat newborns to elderly, from regular maintenance of good health to treatment of health issues such as injuries, sciatica, migraines, back pain, frozen shoulder, arthritis, and pregnancy discomfort.</p>
